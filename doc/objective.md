# Objective

Users of OBS Studio may want to display information about the time that has passed since recording was started. A very simple way to achieve this is to use the "Text (GDI+)" source in OBS Studio and configure it to display time information read from a text file. The text file would need to contain the time elapsed since the recording was started. Such file can, for example, be generated by Snaz's "Chrono Up" functionality.

However, if recording in OBS Studio is paused and resumed later, the Snaz "Chrono Up" will continue to run while the recording is paused. Consequently, the time displayed in OBS will be out of sync, once the recording is resumed.

Whenever OBS's recording state changes, Snaz's "Chrono Up"'s state must be changed accordingly to avoid this problem.

**OBSSnazControl** solves the out-of-sync problem between OBS Studio and Snaz by providing a means to start, pause, resume and stop OBS Studio recording synchronously with Snaz's "Chrono Up".
