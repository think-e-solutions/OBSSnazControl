# ObsSnazControl

ObsSnazControl is a very simple but useful utility to synchronize a [Snaz](https://github.com/JimmyAppelt/Snaz) "Chrono Up" with [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) when the OBS Studio recording needs to be started, paused, resumed and finally stopped.

## Objective
Users of OBS Studio may want to display information about the time that has passed since streaming/recording was started. A very simple way to achieve this is to use the "Text (GDI+)" source in OBS Studio and configure it to display time information read from a text file. The text file would need to contain the time elapsed since the streaming/recording was started. Such file can, for example, be generated by Snaz's "Chrono Up" functionality.

However, if streaming or recording  in OBS Studio is paused and resumed later, the Snaz "Chrono Up" will continue to run while the streaming/recording is paused. Consequently, the time displayed in OBS will be out of sync, once the streaming/recording is resumed.

To avoid this out-of-sync situation, it's mandatory to start, pause, resume and stop Snaz's "Chrono Up" with the current state of streaming/recording in OBS.

If the "Chrono UP" information generated by Snaz is written into a file and the contents of that file is displayed in an OBS Studio scene using the "Text (GDI+)" source,
